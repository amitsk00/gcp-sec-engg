### DLP

#### InfoTypes

* Pre Defined - many options are available
* Custom - can be created based on need - like, custom internal mail ID , and then `likelihood` can be attached to each
    * small/regular custom dict
        * use when list is static 
        * count can be in thousands
        * e.g. Room Names
    * large/stored custom dict
        * when the list is present in bucket or BQ
        * count can be in millions
        * list of phrases is stored in BQ table or bucket file, and then DLP converts that into a dict file (not editable by users)

    * RegEx

* these types can be of INCLUDE or EXCLUDE category
    * Exclude can be used to reduce the outcome
    Hotword - can be used to increase the likelihood
* These can be RegEx , digits with precision, math checksum or prefixes
* `Likelihood` is returns by API to confirm the same as name suggests

#### Inspection 

* Inspection jobs -  You can inspect a BigQuery table, a Cloud Storage bucket or folder, and a Datastore kind
* content.inspect -  method of the DLP API lets you send data directly to the DLP API for inspection
* hybrid job - lets you scan payloads of data sent from any source, and then store the inspection findings in Google Cloud

#### De-Identify

* Create a de-identified copy of Cloud Storage data using an inspection job
* content.deidentify - request to the DLP API

* `dlpJob` to create the job

#### Sensitive Data Protection provides the following method types:

* Content methods - data sent directly to API
* Storage methods - data is stored in storage
* Hybrid methods - request starts as COntent method, but results are stored as Storage


### Inspecting and redacting personally identifiable information (PII)

### Configuring pseudonymization

### Configuring format-preserving substitution

### Restricting access to BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL datastores

## Infra Security

* DDoS
* Firewalls
* IDS/IPS
* WAF
* Container Security


### Automating virtual machine image creation, hardening, maintenance, and patch management

### Automating container image creation, verification, hardening, maintenance, and patch management

### Automating policy as code and drift detection






## Scanning, Logging and Monitoring

* Vuln Scanning
* SIEM





## OS Login

* Manage SSH access to your instances using IAM
* Maintains consistent Linux user identity across VM instances
* Recommended way to manage many users across multiple instances or projects
* SimpliÔ¨Åes SSH access management
