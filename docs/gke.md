## Best Practises

* Private clusters
  * GPA for APIs
  * NAT for internet
  * Control Plane gets addtional Private Endpoint (no public IP)

* Authorized Networks
  * restrict access to Untrusted Actor the control plane to trusted CIDR ranges
  * Mandatory for private clusters

* Shilded Nodes
  * by default

* GKE Secrets
  * KMS to manage GKE KEK

* Bin Authorization

* Workload Identoty

* GKE Sandbox

* Tips
  * Compute Default SA has editor role so better use custom SA for cluster


## RBAC

* Secure your cluster by granting privileged operations (accessing secrets, for example) only to admin users.
* Enforce user-based authentication and authorization by the cluster.
* Limit resource creation (such as pods, persistent volumes, deployments) to specific namespaces.
* Have users and pods only see resources in their authorized namespace. This allows you to isolate resources
* within your organization (for example, between development teams).

!!! Note  ""

    IAM gives access at project level. RBAC can be used to give access at Cluster or Namespace level


## GKE Auth Networks [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/authorized-networks)

* provide an IP-based firewall that controls access to the GKE control plane
* The number of authorized network IP address ranges you can specify for public and private IP addresses depends on the type of cluster:

  * Public cluster: 50 IP address ranges
  * Private cluster: 100 IP address ranges
  * PSC-based clusters: 100 IP address ranges

``` cli
gcloud container clusters create-auto CLUSTER_NAME \
    --enable-master-authorized-networks \
    --master-authorized-networks CIDR1,CIDR2,... \
    --no-enable-google-cloud-access
```

* Network Isolation benefits
  * private and public nodes in same cluster
  * restricted Control Plane access by restricting Google IPs or public IPs

* Isolate Control Plane with `--enable-private-endpoint`
* Isolate Node Pools with
  * Standard cluster with `--enable-private-nodes`
  * Autopilot cluster with ` cloud.google.com/private-node=true`

* After making it private, if no NAT, external Connectivity may fail

## Autopilot [here](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview)

* Google manages cluster config, scaling, security, upgrades
* Autopilot automatically provisions nodes backed by specialized machines, manages scheduling, and allocates hardware
  * Like, Hardware Accelerator for ML, ARM based compute for Mobile apps
* support using node selectors and node affinity to configure **workload separation**
* CLI command is `gcloud container clusters create-auto `
