* Compliance Reports Manager shows all the reports
* Google Cloud meets many third-party and government compliance standards worldwide
* Google Cloud has been certified as secure, but that does not mean that applications built on Google Cloud are automatically certified

* to establish a “minimum security standard” **to protect customers’ payment card information**.
* The Attestation of Compliance provides formal assurance from a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) as to adherence to the PCI DSS.
* This needs regular rotation of keys
* Implement network segmentation
  * place your CDE in a dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
  * VPC not in default mode to avoid extra subnets
  * Implement Tokenization
  * in-scope apps in 1 VPC, out-of-scope apps in another (and if needed, both VPC can be peered)
  * one can use DLP API to sanitize PCI data
* GCP Tools:
  * Firewalls
  * VPC SC
  * VPC COnnectors
  * Implementing Security Command Center
* Requirements:
  * Implement segmentation and boundary protection
  * Configure least-privilege access to Google Cloud resources
  * Establish Organization-level policies

  * Use Secrets
  * Use CMEK for GCR and AR

## FedRamp - Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program

* Authority to Operate (ATO)
* a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to the security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring of cloud products and services
* Google is one of the first hyperscale commercial cloud providers to achieve FedRAMP High on a commercial public cloud offering, and is one of the largest providers of FedRAMP services available on the market today
* Other docs are:

  * Customer Responsibility Matrix (CRM)
  * System Security Plan (SSP)
  * Penetration test reports and other documents

* Best practises:

  * define how to manage system accounts
  * time period of inactivity to log out the user
  * Use Org wide policies
  * define delay post 3 unsuccessful attempts
  * define triggers and conditions to terminate session
  * Use IAM to regulate user access to view, create, delete, and modify specific resources

## ISO 27001

* Requirements for an information security management system (ISMS), specifies a set of best practices
* ONLY GUIDANCE, lays out allow Google to ensure a comprehensive and continually improving model for
security management

## ISO 27018

* cloud privacy: the protection of personally identifiable information (PII)

* Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)
* Detect, investigate, and hunt for threats like never before
* Features:
  * Cloud-scale security analytics
  * Get faster insights with context rich investigation views

  * Active breach detection
  -------
  * Get to the root cause fast with an intuitive workbench
  * Proactively identify threats in your environment
