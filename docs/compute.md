## Confidential VM

* protected by a blend of hardware-grade encryption, memory isolation, and other services that assure workload, data, and platform integrity
* All aspects of a workload are secure even in the event of a physical host breach
* Data at Use is also encrypted with VTPM - only using AMD machines






## Shielded VM


## Boot Integrity

* TPM â€“ module embedded in a system
  * Anchoring the trustworthiness of a system to hardware not software
  * Tamper-resistant security chip installed on the device or built into  PCs, tablets, and phones
  * Stores passwords, certificates, and encryption keys needed to authenticate the platform
* Contributes to Zero Trust for devices and platforms:
  * Integrity (ensures system has not been altered at a low level)
  * Authentication (ensures system is in fact the correct system)
  * Privacy (ensures system is protected from prying eyes)
